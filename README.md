**Image Encryption &amp; Decryption Tool(GUI)**
I am pleased to share a project I developed as part of my internship â€“ a desktop-based Image Encryption Tool built using Python.

This application allowed me to apply my understanding of GUI development with Tkinter and image processing using the Pillow library. It demonstrates how basic encryption techniques can be implemented visually, making the concepts more accessible and interactive.

**Technology Stack**: Python, Tkinter, Pillow (PIL)

**Key Features**:

* Load and preview images in a user-friendly interface
* Encryption using color inversion (generates a negative of the image)
* Encryption using a pixel-swapping algorithm (reverses rows of pixels)
* Decryption of inverted images to restore the original view
* Option to interchange input and output images for further processing
* Save functionality to export the final encrypted or decrypted image
